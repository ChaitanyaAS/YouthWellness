## The Problem

Indian students face immense academic and social pressures, leading to a silent crisis of stress, anxiety, and related health issues. The fear of judgment and stigma creates a major barrier, preventing them from seeking the help they need. This results in a negative cycle of poor sleep, irregular eating, and deteriorating mental well-being.

## Our Solution

**Eudaimonia** (from the Greek for "human flourishing") is a confidential, AI-powered mental wellness solution designed to support and guide Indian youth. We provide a safe, anonymous space where students can understand their mental state without fear. By analyzing the interconnected cycle of stress, sleep, and eating, Eudaimonia offers empathetic, data-driven insights, helping students overcome stigma and take the first step towards accessing help.

## Key Features

* **Anonymous Onboarding:** A private entry with a consent form. No personal data or login is required.
* **Wellness Assessment:** A quick quiz on stress (PSS-10), sleep (SCI), and eating habits.
* **AI Pattern Analysis:** A custom TensorFlow model finds the unique connection between a user's stress, sleep, and eating.
* **Empathetic Feedback:** Uses Google's Gemini API to generate an instant, easy-to-understand wellness report.
* **Crisis Support:** One-click, direct access to verified mental health helplines.

## Technology Stack

The solution is built using a modern, robust technology stack:

* **Backend:** Python 3.10, Flask, Gunicorn
* **Machine Learning / AI:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib, Google Gemini API
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
* **Deployment:** Render (or similar cloud platform)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## System Architecture

The application follows a simple, scalable architecture:
1.  **Frontend:** The user interacts with the web interface built with HTML/CSS/JS.
2.  **Backend (Flask API):** The frontend sends anonymous questionnaire data to the Flask server.
3.  **Data Processing:** The backend preprocesses the data using the saved Scikit-learn scaler.
4.  **AI/ML Model:** The preprocessed data is fed into the trained TensorFlow/Keras model for prediction. The results are also sent to the Google Gemini API to generate empathetic text.
5.  **Response:** The final insights are sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.
